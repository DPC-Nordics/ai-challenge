# AI Assisted Coding Experience
This repository contains a set of coding challenges designed to give developers the chance to understand and experience the power of AI assisted tools in coding. The challenges are organized into 10 use cases, each with increasing difficulty level.

<br>

## How to use this repository

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Implement the functionality for each challenge. The implementation should be done in the `src` directory, under a folder named `challenge-1`, `challenge-2`, and so on.

3. Create a test for the functionality. The test file should be created under the same folder as the implementation. The test files should be named `challenge-1.test.ts`, `challenge-2.test.ts`, and so on.

4. Run the test cases to make sure that _all_ the test are passing.

5. Create a pull request for _each_ challenge you complete in order to keep it simple for review.

6. Add me as a reviewer

<br>

> Please make sure that you do not share your implementation with other developers to keep the integrity of the challenge.

## Next steps

Upon completion of the challenges, both with and without the use of AI assisted tools, kindly prepare a comprehensive review in the form of a review.md file. This review should detail your thoughts and experiences with the utilization of AI assisted tools in comparison to without it. This review will be of great help to understand the effectiveness of AI assisted tools in improving the coding experience.
