# AI Assisted Coding Experience
This repository contains a set of coding challenges designed to give developers the chance to understand and experience the power of AI assisted tools in coding. The challenges are organized into 10 use cases, each with increasing difficulty level.

<br>

## How to use this repository

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Implement the functionality for each challenge. The implementation should be done in the `src` directory, under a folder named `challenge-1`, `challenge-2`, and so on.

3. Create a test for the functionality. The test file should be created under the same folder as the implementation. The test files should be named `challenge-1.test.ts`, `challenge-2.test.ts`, and so on.

4. Run the test cases to make sure that _all_ the test are passing.

5. Create a pull request for _each_ challenge you complete in order to keep it simple for review.

6. Add me as a reviewer

<br>

> Please make sure that you do not share your implementation with other developers to keep the integrity of the challenge.

## Challenges

1. Write a function that takes a string as an input and returns the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the string.
2. Write a function that takes an array of numbers as an input and returns the sum of all even numbers in the array.
3. Write a function that takes an array of numbers as an input and returns the second largest number in the array.
4. Write a function that takes a string as an input and returns a new string with all the vowels removed.
5. Write a function that takes an array of numbers and a target number as inputs, and returns the number of times the target number appears in the array.
      
   _Example_
   
   _input = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 3, 3]_
   
   _target = 3_

   _Result: 3_
6. Write a function that takes a sentence as an input and returns the longest word in the sentence.
7. Write a function that takes a string as an input, and returns the number of words in the string
8. Write a function that takes a string as an input and returns true if the string is a palindrome.
9. Write a function that takes a sentence as an input and returns the most common word in the sentence. 
10. Write a function that takes a matrix (2D array) as input and returns the transpose of the matrix

## Next steps

Upon completion of the challenges, both with and without the use of AI assisted tools, kindly prepare a comprehensive review in the form of a `review.md` file. This review should detail your thoughts and experiences with the utilization of AI assisted tools in comparison to without it. This review will be of great help to understand the effectiveness of AI assisted tools in improving the coding experience.
